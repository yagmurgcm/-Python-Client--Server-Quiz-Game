## Project Description

This project is a **quiz-based game** built with a client–server architecture.

The client side presents multiple-choice questions to the user, collects answers, and displays feedback.  
The server side manages the quiz logic, provides questions, checks answers, and controls the game flow.

Users answer a series of questions, and their responses are evaluated in real time.
